<summary>👉 List of things to do for placing it "Ready in board"</summary>

1. As a **developer** or **reporter**, assign the following fields

    - **Type**
    - **Alignment**: third-party person or entity you will need to interact with for completing this issue
    - Please do not remove the _triage_ label and other properties

2. (optional) As a **developer** or **reporter**, create sub-issues only if necessary (parent/childs)

    Only if there is a clear parent > child relationship for your issues. **Favor issue splitting** (1 specific task = 1 issue) instead of creating child/parent issues. Don't place a parent issue in a sprint: only tasks that can be completed under a sprint should be placed there (child issues).

    However, you are encouraged to set relationships between card.

    - **Priority**
    - **Technical cost**
    - **Business value**
